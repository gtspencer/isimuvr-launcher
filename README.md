# isimuvr-launcher
This was created for iSimu VR, Georgia's first virtual reality arcade.

Created in 2016 as the supplemental launcher for SteamVR, as we discovered it posed serious usability issues for novices to virtual reality.  Thus we sought to build a game launcher that was not only fun, but was rooted in the real world.
